## Customization

### Tailwind Configuration

You can customize the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          50: "#eef2ff",
          // ... other shades
          700: "#4338ca",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

### Mock Data

During development, the app uses mock data located in the `src/mock` directory. You can modify these files to test different scenarios.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Component Structure**: Follow the atomic design pattern. Create small, reusable components in the `common` folder and compose them into larger components.

2. **State Management**: Use Zustand for global state. Keep component state local when possible.

3. **Responsive Design**: Always design with mobile-first approach. Test on multiple screen sizes.

4. **TypeScript**: Maintain strict typing. Create interfaces for all components and data structures.

5. **Code Formatting**: The project uses ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting.

  ArcElement,
  LineElement,
  BarElement,
  PointElement,
  LineController,
  BarController,
  CategoryScale,
  LinearScale,
  Legend,
  Tooltip,
} from "chart.js";

Chart.register(
  ArcElement,
  LineElement,
  BarElement,
  PointElement,
  LineController,
  BarController,
  CategoryScale,
  LinearScale,
  Legend,
  Tooltip
);
