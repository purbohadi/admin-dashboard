Mock Data
During development, the app uses mock data located in the src/mock directory. You can modify these files to test different scenarios.

Development Guidelines
Component Structure : Follow the atomic design pattern. Create small, reusable components in the common folder and compose them into larger components.
State Management : Use Zustand for global state. Keep component state local when possible.
Responsive Design : Always design with mobile-first approach. Test on multiple screen sizes.
TypeScript : Maintain strict typing. Create interfaces for all components and data structures.
Code Formatting : The project uses ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting.
